                <p>My mother is a hero to me for a variety of reasons. She has been a consistent source of support and strength in my life, guiding me through many difficult times since I can remember. She has overcome countless challenges with unflinching tenacity and resilience, always managing to provide for our family on her own. Regardless of the obstacles she faced, she never sought help from others, exhibiting remarkable independence and ingenuity. Her ability to manage various responsibilities while ensuring that I got what I needed has left me feeling deeply grateful and admirable. Her sacrifices and dedication impacted who I am today, and I strive to exhibit the same courage and compassion that she has demonstrated throughout my life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I am an enthusiastic, creative, idealistic ENFP who is always coming up with new ideas and trying new things. In group settings, I thrive on motivating people and building relationships. But because I tend to think quickly, I often struggle to stay focused and follow through, so I have to create clear objectives and divide tasks into small, digestible chunks. My passion for advocating stems from my strong ideals, but I've learned how to deal with disappointment when my expectations aren't met. I look for jobs that seem like a calling, appreciating freedom and significant influence while accepting my personal growth challenges and abilities.</p>
